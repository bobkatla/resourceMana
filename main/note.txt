This will be the place I write down what exactly I need to do

The goal
- Setup standard env for the resource management
- Can just input the action deciser (caculate the probability). E.g: Q-learning, SARSA
- Plotting the needed graph (how to get the needed data to compare)

Struct:
- The setup will setup the env for training/ testing
- The re_algo to store the algo for training, return model/agent
- The decider will to store the agents, return the action will take (which task will be executed)
- The plot will store how to plot
- launcher file will be the place user input what they wanna do (the only endpoint)
- We will need some way to store all the data (outside file such as numpy file)
